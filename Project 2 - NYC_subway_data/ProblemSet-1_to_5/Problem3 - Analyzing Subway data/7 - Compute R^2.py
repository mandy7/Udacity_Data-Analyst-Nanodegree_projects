    '''
    In exercise 5, we calculated the R^2 value for you. But why don't you try and
    and calculate the R^2 value yourself.
    
    Given a list of original data points, and also a list of predicted data points,
    write a function that will compute and return the coefficient of determination (R^2)
    for this data.  numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() might both be useful here, but
    not necessary.

    # your code here
    r_squared = 1.0 - np.square(data - predictions).sum()/np.square(data - np.mean(data)).sum()
    return r_squared
