>>> import datetime

def reformat_subway_dates(date):
    '''
    The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.
    
    In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.
    
    Hint: 
    There is a useful function in the datetime library called strptime.

    date_formatted = datetime.datetime.strptime(date, '%m-%d-%y').strftime('%Y-%m-%d')# formate datatime formation
    return date_formatted
